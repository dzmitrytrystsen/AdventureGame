  storyText: "B6. Running\r\nYou run down a long corridor then up a flight of metal
    stairs. They make a loud racket as you clamber up them. Thank goodness the machinery
    in this place is so loud.\r\n\r\nIn front of you is the emergency exit door. It
    has an oversized, cast iron lock hanging from a bolted handle. You could try picking
    the lock, or maybe look for a way to pry it off.\r\n\r\nWhat to do?\r\n\r\n1.
    Pick it.\r\n2. Pry it."
