  storyText: "A8. Evesdropping\r\nYou slink through the machinery towards 2 skanky
    looking men. The tall, scrawny one is carrying an oversized gas-canister-powered
    arrow shooter, while the shorter dumpy man has strapped to him at least a dozen
    small glass bottles with grey liquid inside.\r\n\r\nThe stout fellow finishes
    cranking a large valve (clockwise you notice) and then both men dash off with
    much haste.\r\n\r\nWhat to do?\r\n\r\n1. Quick, uncrank that valve, they were
    clearly up to no good.\r\n2. Chase the men."
