  storyText: "A2. In A Cell\nWell, that was pretty stupid. You sustain a brutal beating
    and end up dumped in a dirty cell. The bars are thick cast iron. The door is old
    and patched together with plate metal and thick red wires.\r\n\r\nYou have no
    idea where you are. And your head hurts.\r\n\r\nSo, what to do now, slugger?\r\n\r\n1.
    Wait it out. My head hurts.\r\n2. Slam into the door with all my might."
